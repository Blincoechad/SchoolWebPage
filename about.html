              Dr. Potts is a retired veterinarian who has dedicated his life to
              the service of both animals and humans. After earning his DVM
              degree from Auburn University, he opened the Ruskin Animal
              Hospital and Cat Clinic in 1971. Dr. Potts philanthropy extends
              beyond animal care. He has been involved in providing meals and
              education for children in Haiti, assisting farmers with funds to
              grow and sell their crops, and supporting Smile Train, a nonprofit
              that provides free corrective surgery for children with cleft lips
              and palates. Dr. Potts dedication to service is evident in his
              belief that "the more you give generously from the heart,
              soulfully and without any intention of getting anything in return,
              it comes back to you many times over." His legacy of service, both
              to his community and to the broader world, is a testament to this
              belief. He is truly an example of using time wisely and making a
              positive impact on the world.
